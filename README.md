# Section 11: Mastering Abstraction & Interfaces: Expand Polymorphism & Java Hierarchies

149. Abstraction & Generalization: Less Code, More Extensibility
    1. 

150. Exploring Abstract & Interface Modifiers: Real-World Modeling in Java
    1. Generalization and Abstraction
    2. Abstraction
    3. Java's support for Abstraction
    4. Abstract method
    5. Concrete method
    6. Method Modifiers

151. Diving into Abstract Classes (Part 1): Creating Flexible Hierarchies
    1. Abstraction - What is it?
    2. The abstract class
    3. What's an abstract method?
    4. What good is an abstract method, if it doesn't have any code in it?
    5. Animal and Dog Class Diagram from our Inheritance example

152. Diving into Abstract Classes (Part 2): Polymorphic Behavior & Implementation
    1. Code Challenge

153. Diving into Abstract Classes (Part 3): Advanced Hierarchies & Use Cases
    1. Continued code practice
    2. An Abstract class doesn't have to implement abstract methods
    3. Why use an abstract class?

154. Abstract Class Challenge (Part 1): Building a Storefront & Product Hierarchy
    1. Abstract Class Challenge

155. Abstract Class Challenge (Part 2): Finalizing the Store & Order System
    1. Abstract Class Challenge Continued

156. Interfaces (Part 1): Harnessing Contracts & Polymorphic Behavior in Java
    1. Interface vs. Abstract class
    2. Declaring an interface
    3. Using an interface
    4. A class can use extends and implements in same declaration
    5. The abstract modifier is implied on an interface
    6. All members on an interface are implicitly public

157. Interfaces (Part 2): Multiple Implementations & Real-World Examples
    1. The Bird Class
    2. The FlightEnabled Interface
    3. The final modifier in Java
    4. Constatns in Java
    5. A field declared on an Interface is always public, static and final 

158. Interfaces (Part 3): Constants, Conversion & Flexible Abstractions
    1. Extending Interfaces
    2. Implements is invalid on an interface
    3. Abstracted Types - Coding to an Interface
    4. Coding to an interface

159. Interfaces & JDK 8 Enhancements: Default/Static Methods for Compatibility
    1. What's happended to the Interface since JDK 8
    2. The Interface Extension Method - the default method (as of JDK8)
    3. Overriding a default method

160. Interfaces & JDK 9 Enhancements: Private & Static Methods in Action
    1. public static methods on an interface (as of JDK 8)
    2. Private methods (JDK 9)
