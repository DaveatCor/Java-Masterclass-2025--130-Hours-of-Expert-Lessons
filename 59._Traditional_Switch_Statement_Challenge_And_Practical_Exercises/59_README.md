## Switch Challenge

We'll be using the NATO alphabet to replace a character or letter, with NATO's standardized word for that letter.

In radio transmissions, the world car, "C", "A", "R", would be read, "Charlie Able Roger", for clarity.

We'll take a single character, and return the matching word from the NATO phonetic alphabet, shown on this slide

To do this:
1. Create a new char variable.
2. Use the traditional switch statement (with a colon in case labels) that tests the value in the variable from Step 1.
- Create cases for the character, A, B, C, D, and E.
- Display a message in each case block, with the letter and the NATO word, then break.
- Add a default block, which displays the letter with a message saying not found.
