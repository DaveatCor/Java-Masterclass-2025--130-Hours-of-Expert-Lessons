## Introduction to Lambda Expressions
Welcome to the Lambda Expressions section of the course.

While I considered introducing this topic earlier, it’s important to have a solid understanding of core Java concepts before tackling lambda expressions. These expressions, introduced in Java with JDK 8, are now an essential feature and are supported by various methods within Java’s interfaces and classes.

Lambda expressions can be a bit challenging to grasp initially, especially when trying to unlock their full potential. That’s why it made sense to first build a strong foundation before exploring these more advanced features.

Think of a lambda expression as a shorthand for an anonymous class that implements a functional interface—an interface that contains only a single abstract method. This makes your code more concise and easier to understand.

Lambda expressions allow you to pass blocks of code as parameters, offering a powerful and flexible way to write cleaner and more functional code with minimal effort. These compact and expressive constructs can greatly simplify your programming tasks.

Method references build on this concept, providing an even more concise way to refer to existing methods using lambda expression syntax.

By the end of this section, I hope you’ll be excited about the new possibilities that lambda expressions bring and feel ready to use them effectively in your projects.

In the final part of this section, I’ll introduce you to some handy default and static methods available on many interfaces. These methods can help you reduce repetitive coding tasks, so be sure to explore this part in detail.
