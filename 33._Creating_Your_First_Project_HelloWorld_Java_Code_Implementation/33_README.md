## Naming Items in Java

Camel case is the practice of capitalizing the first letter of words in a name for readability, removing spaces or characters such as underscores between the words. Lower camel case only capitalizes the first letter of the second and subsequent words. Upper camel case, also known as Pascal case, capitalizes the first letter of the first word as well.

| Class Name | Java element | Upper Camel Case | NewClass |
| Method Name | Java element | Lower Camel Case | getData |
