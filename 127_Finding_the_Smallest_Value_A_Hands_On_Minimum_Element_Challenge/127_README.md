## Minimum Element Challenge
- Write a method called <b>readIntegers</b> that reads a comma delimited list of numbers entered by the user from the console, and then returns an <b>array</b> containing the numbers that were entered.
- Next, write a method called `findMin` that takes the array as an argument and returns the <b>minimum value</b> found in that <b>array</b>.

- In the <b>main method</b>:
    - Call the <b>method readIntegers</b> to get the array of integers from the user, and print these out using a method found in `java.util.Arrays`.  
    - Next, call the <b>findMin method</b>, passing the <b>array</b>, returned from the call to the <b>readIntegers method</b>.
    - Print the <b>minimum element</b> in the <b>array</b>, which should be returned from the <b>findMin method</b>.
- A tip here. Assume that the user will only enter numbers, so you don't need to do any validation for the console input.
