## Access Modifiers

The <b>public</b> java keyword is what's called an <b>access modifier</b>.

```java
public class FirstClass {
    public static void main(String[] args){
        System.out.print("Hello World");
    }
}
```

## Class Keyword

The <b>class</b> keyword is used to define a clas. The class name will be the text following the keyword, so <b>FirstClass</b> in this case.

Notice the <b>left and right curly braces</b>, they are used to define the class code block, or class body.

```java
public class FirstClass {
    public static void main(String[] args){
        System.out.print("Hello World");
    }
}
```

## What is a method

A method is a collection of statements, one or more, that perform an operation. We'll be using a special method called the main method, that Java looks for when running a program.

It's the entry point for any Java code, and Java looks for this main method to start and run the program.

You can also create your own methods.
