## Introduction to the Collection Framework
We'ave previously explored the `List` and `Iterator` interfaces, as well as the `ArrayList` and `LinkedList` classes, which are functional component of this powerful library.

In this section, we'll take a closer look at how these types fit into the broader framework of interfaces and classes that make up the Collections Framework. we'll also introduce other essential collection types, including `Set` and `Map`.

By the end the this section, we'll have a Stronger grasp of additional classes that will significantly enhance our ability to manage and manipulate groups of objects.
