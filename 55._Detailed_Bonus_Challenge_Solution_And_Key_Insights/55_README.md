## Seconds And Minutes Challenge Bonus:

In this part of the challenge, we'll add validation to the method as a bonus:
- For the first method,
    - the seconds parameter should be >= 0.
- For the second method,
    - the minutes parameter should be >= 0.
        - and the seconds parameter should be >= 0 and <= 59.
- If either method is passed an invalid value, print out some type of meaningful message to the user.
