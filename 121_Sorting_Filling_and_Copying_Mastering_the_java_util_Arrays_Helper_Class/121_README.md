## Why use arrays?
We use arrays to manage many items of the same type.

Some common behaviors for arrays include sorting, initializing values, copying the array, and finding an element.

In the last video, this behavior isn't on the array instance itself, but rather provided on a helper, `java.util.Arrays`.
