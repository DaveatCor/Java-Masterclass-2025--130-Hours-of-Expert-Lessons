## Whitespace

What is whitespace?
- Whitespace is any extra spacing, horizontally or vertically, placed around Java source code.
- It's usually added for human readability purposes.
- In Java, all these extra spaces are ignored.

So Java treats code like this:

```java
int anotherVariable = 50; myVariable--; System.out.println("myVariable" + myVariable);
```

the same as code like this:

```java
int anotherVariable = 50; 
myVariable--; 
System.out.println("myVariable" + myVariable);
```

## Whitespace Coding Conventions

Code conventions for whitespace do exist, which you can refer to for more detail.

The Google Java Style Guide which was seen previously in this course, has a section on whitespace, so refer to that for more information.
