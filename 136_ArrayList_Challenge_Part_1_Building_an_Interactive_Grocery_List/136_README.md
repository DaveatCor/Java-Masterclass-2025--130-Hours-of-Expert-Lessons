## The ArrayList Challenge
The challenge is to create an interactive console program, with a menu of options as shown, here, and functionality that we will describe now:

`
Available actions:
0 - to shutdown
1 - to add Items(s) to list (comma delimited list)
2 - to remove any items(s) (comma delimited list)
Enter a number for which action we want to do:
`

Using the Scanner class, solicit a menu choice, 0, 1, 2 and process the item accordingly.

The list will be a grocery list and should be an ArrayList.

We should use methods on the ArrayList to add items, remove items, check if an item is already in the list, and print a sorted list.

We should print the list, sorted alphabetically, after each operation.

We shouldn't allow duplicate items in the list.
