## The Array Challenge
Create a program using arrays that <b>sorts</b> a list of <b>integers</b> in <b>descending order</b>.  Descending order means from highest value to lowest.

In other words, if the array has the values 50, 25, 80, 5, and 15, your program should return an array with the values 
in the descending order: 80, 50, 25, 15,  and 5.

First, create an <b>array</b> of <b>randomly generated integers</b>.

Print the array before you sort it.

And print the array after you sort it.

You can choose to create a new sorted array or just sort the current array.
