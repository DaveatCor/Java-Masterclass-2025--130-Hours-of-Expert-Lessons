## Classes Challenge Exercise
## Object Oriented Challenge

Create a new class for a bank account.

Create fields for account characteristics like:
- account number
- account balance.
- customer name.
- email.
- phone number.

Create getters and setters for each field.

Create two additional methods:
- one for depositing funds into the account.
- one for withdrawing funds from the account.

A customer should not be allowed to withdraw funds if that withdrawal takes their balance negative.

Crate a new project called `ClassesChallenge` with the usual Main class with the usual main method.

We'll create an instance of an `Account` class and then test our withdraw and deposit methods.

We'll print information to the console that confirms what the balance is after the methods are called.
