## if then else Challenge

Insert a code segment after the code we've just reviewed:
- Set the existing <b>score</b> variable to 10,000.
- Set the existing <b>levelCompleted</b> variable to 8.
- Set the existing <b>bonus</b> variable to 200/
- Use the same <b>if</b> condition. Meaning if gameOver is true, then you want to perform the same calculation, and print out the value of the <b>finalScore</b> variable.
