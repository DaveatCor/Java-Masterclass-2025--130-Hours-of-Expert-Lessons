## Introduction
Up to this point in the course, we've covered most of the core functionality in Java.

We want to take this moment, to loop back to some topics we dind't cover at all, or in engouh
detail, or only metioned in passing.

This s functionality we may find ourselves using daily, and although the topics are less
exciting, they're no less important.

In this ection, we'll review the Match class, some additional randomization features, and the BigDecimal class.

After this. we'll be talking about date and time topics, covering many of Java's features in the java.time package.

This will segue nicely into a discussion about Java's support fo Localization and Internationalization.

By the end of this ection, we can boast that we know most of Java's core features.

There's still a lot to cover, and we want to congratulate for perservering this far!.
