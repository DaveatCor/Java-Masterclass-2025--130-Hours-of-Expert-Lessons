## Array Introduction
In the last two sections, we learned about different ways to create classes, which can have any number and type of data elements.

What we haven't really discussed though, is a way to have multiple values, all of the same type.s

We had a taste of this kind of problem in the Bill's Burger challenge.

We had several topping for our burger, and we had to create individual attributes for each. This led to inefficient code and other limitations. For example, what if we needed ten toppings? There are much better way to handle this.

Java provides use with many types of containers to store multiple values of the same type.

These start with the most basic, which is the array, and that's what this section will cover.
