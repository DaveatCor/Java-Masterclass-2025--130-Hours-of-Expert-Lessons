## Challenge

Step 1: create a double variable with a value of 20.00.
Step 2: create a second variable of type double with a value of 80.00.
Step 3: add both nubmers together, then multiply by 100.00.
Step 4: use the remainder operators, to figure out what the remainder from the result of the operation in step three, and 40.00, will be.
Step 5: create a boolean variable that assigns the value true, if the remainder in the step four is 0.00, or false if it's not zero.
Step 6: output the boolean variable just to see what the result is.
Step 7: write an if-then statement that displays a message, 'got some remainder', if the boolean in step five is not true.
