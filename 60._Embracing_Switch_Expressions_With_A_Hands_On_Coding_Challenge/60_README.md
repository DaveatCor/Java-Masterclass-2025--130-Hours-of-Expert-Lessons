## Day of the Week Challenge

1. Create a method called printDayOfWeek, that takes an int parameter called day, but doesn't return any values.
- Use the enhanced switch statement, to return the name of the day, based on the parameter passed to the switch statement, so that 0 will return "Sunday", 1 will return "Monday", and so on. Any number not between 0 and 6, should return "Invalid Day".
Note that return here, means the value returned from the enhanced switch statement.
- Use the enhanced switch statement as an expression, returning the result to String named dayOfTheWeek.
- Print both the day variable and the dayOfTheDay variable.
