## Constructor chaining with this()
Constructor chaining is when one constructor explicitly calls another overloaded constructor.

We can only use constructor chaining, within constructors.

We must use the special statement `this()` to execute another constructor, passing it argument if required.

<b>And `this()` must be the first executable statement if it's used from another constructor</b>
