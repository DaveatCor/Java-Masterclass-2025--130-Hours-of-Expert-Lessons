## Reading User Input Challenge

In this challenge, you'll read <b>5</b> valid numbers from the console entered by the user and print the sum of those five numbers.
By valid numbers, I mean you need to check that the numbers entered are valid integers. 
If they are not, print out the message <b>"Invalid number"</b> to the console, but continue looping until you do have 5 valid numbers.
Before the user enters each number, prompt them with the message, <b>"Enter number #x:"</b>, where x represents the count <b>1, 2, 3</b>, etc.
As an example, the first message would look something like, <b>"Enter number #1:"</b>, the next, <b>"Enter number #2:"</b>, and so on.
