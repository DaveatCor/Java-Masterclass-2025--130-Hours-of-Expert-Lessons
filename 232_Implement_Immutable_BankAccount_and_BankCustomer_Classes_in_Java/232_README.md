## Challenge: Write Immutable classes for a Bank Account and a Bank Customer

In this challenge, we should create a <b>BankAccount</b> class.

This should have a type, indicating the type of account, like Checking or Savings or some other type.

It should have a balance, the initial dollar amount in the account.

You should also create a <b>BankCustomer</b> class that has a customer name, a customer id, and a List of accounts.

You should use the techniques I discussed in the last videos, to design these classes.

Create a couple of instances of bank customers, confirming that you can't change a customer's data at all, after it's initialized.

Create a subclass of the bank customer and confirm that the subclass can't tamper with the customer's data as well.
