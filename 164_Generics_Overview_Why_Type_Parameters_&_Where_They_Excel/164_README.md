## Generic Introduction
Welcome to a new section focusing on another crucial topic in Java: Generics.

If we've been following this course sequentially, we should now be comfortable with generalizing our class designs conceptually.

This involves identifying commonalities among our classes to think about them in a broader sense.

Generics enable us to create and design classes in a generalized manner, without being concerned about the specific details of the elements they might contain.

A prime example of a generic class in Java is the ArrayList.

We can use an ArrayList for any type of object because many of its methods are applicable to any type.

Let's dive in to learn how to create generic types, explore their usage, and understand when they should be used.
