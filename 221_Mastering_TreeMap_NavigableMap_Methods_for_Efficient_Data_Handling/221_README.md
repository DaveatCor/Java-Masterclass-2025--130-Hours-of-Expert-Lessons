## TreeMap's View collections
| View collection methods                                                                                    | Notes                                                                                                                         |

| entrySet(), keyset(), values()                                                                             | Provides views of mappings, keys and values. These are views available to any map, and not just the TreeMap. These are views. |
| descendingKeySet()<br>descendingKeyMap()                                                                   | Provides reversed order eky set or map, revered by the key values.                                                            |
| headMap(K key)<br>headMap(K key, boolean inclusive)<br>tailMap(K key)<br>tailMap(K key, boolean inclusive) | Provides views of either the first or last parts of the map, divided by the key passed.                                       |
| subMap(K fromKey, K toKey)<br>subMap(K fromKey, boolean inclusive, K toKey, boolean inclusive)             | |                                                                                                                              | Provides a view of a contiguous section of the map, heigher or equal to the fromkey and lower than the toKey, so the <b>toKey is EXCLUSIVE</b><br><br>The overloaded version allows us to determine the inclusivity us want for both keys |
