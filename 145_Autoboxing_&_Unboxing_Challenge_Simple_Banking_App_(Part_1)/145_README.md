## Autoboxing Challenge with ArrayLists

Okay, so it's time for a challenge on autoboxing and unboxing.

In this challenge, we'll need to create a simple banking application with a Customer and Bank type.

The <b>Customer</b> will have a name and an <b>ArrayList</b> of transactions containing <b>Double</b> wrapper elements. 
- A customer's transaction can be a credit, which means a positive amount, or it can be a debit, a negative amount.

The <b>Bank</b> will have a name, and an <b>ArrayList</b> of customers.
- The bank should <b>add a new customer</b>, if they're not yet already in the list.
- The bank class should allow a customer to <b>add a transaction</b>, to an existing Customer.
- This class should also <b>print a statement</b>, that includes the customer name, and the transaction amounts.  This method should use unboxing.
