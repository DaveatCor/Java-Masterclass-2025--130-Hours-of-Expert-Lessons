## The Logical AND operator and the Logical OR operator

The <b>and</b> operator comes in two flavours in Java, as does the <b>or</b> operator.

<b>&&</b> is the Logical <b>and</b> whihc operates on <b>boolean</b> operands - Checking if a given condition is <b>true</b> or <b>false</b>.

The <b>&</b> is a bitwise operator working at the bit level. This is an advanced concept.

Likewise `||` is the logic <b>or</b>, and again it operates on <b>boolean</b> operands - Checking if a given condition is <btrue</b> or <b>false</b>.

The | is a bitwise operators, which is also working at the bit level.
